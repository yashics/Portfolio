I am actively involved in coding and am a member of Fractal, a coding club at our institute. As a member, I assist in teaching our juniors to enhance their coding skills and help clarify their doubts. Additionally, I am part of a social club at IET, which focuses on assisting students from underprivileged sections of society. We organize free tuition classes and guide students through the process of enrolling in various government schemes and scholarships to obtain admission at no cost.

Recently, I participated in a Hackathon at Myntra Hackerkamp, We for She 2024, where my team, Cipher Sisters, secured a position in the pre-finals. We developed a Fashion AI Community App that includes a Fashion AI Image Generator. The app generates images based on user prompts, which can be downloaded for further use.

In addition to my academic work, I completed a one-month summer internship as a Full Stack Developer, which gave me hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end technologies. I worked on building responsive web applications, understanding databases, and creating smooth user interfaces. This experience sharpened my technical skills and taught me to work under tight deadlines while collaborating effectively with a team.
